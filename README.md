**AIM OF THE PROJECT**
This project aims to enforce security rules on accessing a pdf document allowing the owner of the document to:
• have control over who is accessing what in his document.
• view, at any time, the sequence of changes done to the document.
• track the path followed by a piece of data accessed by a peer from its origin to its destination.
This is being done using the concept of a blockchain called ”Artichoke” that stores and manipulates an immutable sequence of peer-action verified by all peers in the network.
The document is a pdf file containing data fields about the owner of the document. 

**WHAT WE USE**
We used icedPDF viewer library to deals with pdf, and java library to implement our solution in Eclipse.
